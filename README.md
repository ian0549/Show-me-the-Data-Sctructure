# Show me the Data Sctructure

For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the data structures and algorithm course in udacity. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.


# Project Topics

###  Least Recently Used Cache

An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. For the current problem, consider both get and set operations as an use operation.

Your job is to use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the cache.

In case of a cache hit, your get() operation should return the appropriate value.
In case of a cache miss, your get() should return -1.
While putting an element in the cache, your put() / set() operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first and then insert the element.
All operations must take O(1) time.

For the current problem, you can consider the size of cache = 5.


### File Recursion

For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

The test directory can be found in the porject files as test.zip

Note: os.walk() is a handy Python method which can achieve this task very easily. However, for this problem you are not allowed to use os.walk().


### Huffman Coding

The Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. Let us understand the two phases - encoding and decoding with the help of an example.

A. Huffman Encoding
Assume that we have a string message AAAAAAABBBCCCCCCCDDEEEEEE comprising of 25 characters to be encoded. The string message can be an unsorted one as well. We will have two phases in encoding - building the Huffman tree (a binary tree), and generating the encoded data.


B. Huffman Decoding
Once we have the encoded data, and the (pointer to the root of) Huffman tree, we can easily decode the encoded data using the following steps:

Declare a blank decoded string
Pick a bit from the encoded data, traversing from left to right.
Start traversing the Huffman tree from the root.
If the current bit of encoded data is 0, move to the left child, else move to the right child of the tree if the current bit is 1.
If a leaf node is encountered, append the (alphabetical) character of the leaf node to the decoded string.
Repeat steps #2 and #3 until the encoded data is completely traversed.
You will have to implement the logic for both encoding and decoding in the following template. Also, you will need to create the sizing schemas to present a summary.


### Active Directory

In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

Write a function that provides an efficient look up of whether the user is in a group.


### Blockchain

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.


### Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Your task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and perform your own run time analysis on the code.
