Blockchain

According to the project,

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. 
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. 
For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

We used a Linked list class to append blocks to together in a sequence.

the time complexity for adding blocks is O(1)
while the time complexity for returning the blocks as list is O(n) where n is the numbr of blocks
