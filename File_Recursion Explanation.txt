Finding Files 
For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with a ".c" extension.

We used recursion to traverse the file hierachy tree whild building a path. Then we check if the path is a file and check again if it ends with ".c", 
otherwise we continue with the recursion.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the file hierachy tree. 
The space complexity is also O(n) were n represent the files with the desired extention
