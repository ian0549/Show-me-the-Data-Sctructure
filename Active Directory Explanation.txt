Active Directory

Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. 
The program recursively explores each directory and its sub-directories on whether or not a user is a member of the given group. 

The time and space complexity is O(n * b) where n is the number of groups in a group and b is the number of users in each of those groups
