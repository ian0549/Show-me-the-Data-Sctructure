Project Discription 

Build a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. 
An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

In this project, the cache enteries were stored in a dictionary and a queue was used from python collection deque for keeping track of cache histroy or key entries,
The Time complexity is O(1) using dictionaries and qeues and the space complexity is O(n) the size of the Cache.
