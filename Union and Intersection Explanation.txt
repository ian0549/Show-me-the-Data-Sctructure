
Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists


The task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. 
The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

The intersection part utilized sets from python's collection to find the union between the two linked lists.

Both union and intersection functions required the traversing of the linked lists, and therefore
the time complexity is O(n) where n is the mas length of the two linked lists.
the space complexity is for intersection is O(1) because sets use constant amoun of space irrespective of input size.
on the other hand, that of union function is O(n) were n denotes the number of data stored in list.
